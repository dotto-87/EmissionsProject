    "# Introduction\n",
    "Climate change is a crucial issue faced by all nations worldwide. The sense of urgency has been emphasised recently as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report declaring that climate change is “widespread, rapid, and intensifying” (2021), and was described by the UN Secretary-General as a “code red for humanity” (Chestney & Januta, 2021).  At a UN summit in Paris in 2015, governments of 196 nations pledged to alleviate climate change by “[reducing] their Greenhouse Gas emissions” (UNFCCC, 2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "Nations have also been taking measures to reduce emissions prior to 2015 (Quince & Phillips, 2015). Two sources of GHG emissions commonly identified are energy use, particularly for electricity, and transport use, particularly the use of cars and road transport (WWF-UK, 2021). Solutions for reducing GHG emissions come in two primary forms: conserving and being more efficient with energy use (Geneva College, 2021), and developing and deploying new technologies including renewable energy and lower-emission and zero-emission vehicles (Niranjan, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we will look at how nations have been performing in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach targets of “climate neutrality (UNFCCC, 2016). This report shall focus on OECD (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries with BRIICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, South Africa) as these nations have historically and recently been major contributors to GHG emissions (OECD, 2021b). \n",

    "# Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It is vital to the future of the planet that greenhouse gas emissions be reduced and climate change mitigated. The world is already on track to reach dangerous levels of global warming (Chestney & Januta, 2021). The OECD and other major of the world emit greenhouse gases at rates much higher than other countries (OECD, 2021b) and it is important that countries bring down not only their total emissions, but also the emissions each person in major nations emit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis has shown little correlation in per capita greenhouse gas emissions with the GDP per capita or the population density of a country. This suggests that reducing emissions need not require reducing the economic productivity of the people. Countries with lower GHG emissions per capita do not share any particular profile whereby they emit less from transport, electricity, or any particular sector.  Furthermore, while it is debatable whether the emissions reductions are sufficient enough to reduce climate change (Abnett, 2021), most OECD nations have made reductions in GHG emissions per capita, and several have made significant reductions, as much as by one third to one half in the period from 1990 to 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reductions in this timeframe appear to be mostly correlated with a lower energy use per capita. This means that efforts to improve the efficiency of energy use have brought the strongest results so far. Such contributions include improving energy efficiency of buildings (The Government of the United Kingdom, 2020) and improving the efficiency of appliances and equipment, an initiative that many OECD countries have taken up  (ACEEE, AEEE, ECEEE, 2019). Renewable energy is another contributor, however while its adoption over the past three decades has shown results especially in the top GHG emission reducers, there is not as much correlation between per capita emissions reductions as there is with energy conservation. As top reducers have increased their renewable energy consumption as much as 14 fold, it is possible that stronger investment in renewable energy by other countries could drive further reductions. \n",
    " \n",
    "The emissions reductions over the timeframe concerned do not correlate with car usage, which has in fact risen across all countries for which relevant data could be found. Fuel consumption per motor vehicle has decreased in some countries, but the correlation is weak. It would appear that road transport in particular is currently a small factor in reducing climate change emissions. However, with all transport accounting for 23% of OECD member’s GHG emissions on average, it is still worth pursuing. According to the International Energy Agency, zero-emission electric vehicles only made up for 2.5% of all car sales worldwide (2021). As electric vehicles become more widespread, it is possible that they will lead to more significant reductions in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top reducers have made reductions in energy use and motor fuel use, and  significantly increased their use of renewable energy in most cases. Other countries are encouraged look to these methods, in particular energy conservation and efficiency, to reduce their GHG emissions. \n"

    "# Future Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the Discussion and Conclusion, one possible reason that correlations are weak between certain factors, such as reduced motor fuel use, is that the adoption is not significantly advanced enough. Further analysis in these areas is encouraged. \n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected industries and transportation habits of people worldwide in 2020 onward. Data from BP already suggests that global carbon emissions fell by 6.3% in 2020 (BP, 2021, p. 15). New living trends including telecommuting, as well as reduced flight use, likely contributed strongly to these emissions (Jiang, et al., 2021). For the purpose of GHG reductions, it would be beneficial to analyse the impact and long-term viability of these measures on emissions so that environmentally successful initiatives could be maintained. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, more detailed analysis of energy use across various sectors could better identify other possibilities in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Such possibilities include looking at which renewable energies are the best contributors to GHG emission reductions. Another such possibility is analysing air transport. Due to the popular focus on electric vehicle and reducing car usage (The Government of the United Kingdom, 2020) (Niranjan, 2019), road transport was the primary focus for this analysis. However, aviation is a potentially significant contributor, the emissions of which accounting for 3.8% of global CO2 emissions in the EU in 2018 and previously forecasted (before the pandemic) to triple (European Commission, 2021). Detailed data analysis can provide invaluable insight into methods of reducing global emissions and mitigating climate change.\n"
